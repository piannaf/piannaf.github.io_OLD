          <p>I’ve been trying to <del>break</del> understand electronics since I was a toddler. Trying
to install software on an old IBM in 3rd grade was wonderful and teaching my
5th grade teacher how to use Windows was eye opening. My first programmable
calculator (TI 86) was mind opening.</p>

<p>I began to get serious about programming as a hobby in high school where I
taught myself PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I got really serious when I
decided I should try to get a minor in Computer Engineering but that was too
much of a workload on top of Physics and Math and Music so it continued to be a
hobby.</p>

<p>After graduating from college and wanting to see a bit of the world, I took a
trip to Taiwan where I didn’t use any of my degrees. On the train to work,
though, I became proficient in C. At home, I learned how to program with
Ruby on Rails, the YouTube API, and Git.</p>

<p>In order to turn my hobby into a career, I joined the Masters of IT by
Coursework program at the University of Queensland. Because of my drive and
passion for this subject, I was able to complete it with high distinction
(7 out of 7 GPA). I was able to get my first programming job at Intec in
Brisbane on the combined Convergent Billing and Process Engine team. Intec was
soon bought by CSG International but I continued to work on the development of
Singleview.</p>

<p>After 4 years in Brisbane, I was ready to try another country. CSG didn’t have
any immediate openings available (in countries I hadn’t already been to), but I
found a job in Japan consulting for Lingo Network. I worked as a developer and
Scrum Master for their client, Ericsson Japan, working on software used to
optimise telecommunication radio networks. The project I was part of was so
successful, our team joined a global project based in Spain. After a year, we
were asked to relocate to Spain, but I wasn’t ready to leave Japan.</p>

<p>My next opportunity was huge: a full time Scrum Master for the IBM Marketing
Experience Lab in Tokyo. As IBM’s core competence is in technology, they tapped
into long-time partner Ogilvy &amp; Mather to find me. I am employed by Ogilvy, an
extremely fun and dynamic company, working at IBM, a highly respected company
and industry leader. We are working on innovative projects that combine Agile
development practices, Design Thinking, and Lean UX to create or improve
internal and external tools and services.</p>
