          <p>The array-based data structures were partially written for us and we needed to
fix them to pass the given tests and ensure they will pass any other relevant
tests thrown at them. The link-based data structures had to be implemented from scratch, only the interfaces were given.</p>

<p>This was an easy assignment since I had already written a linked-list in C the semester before and was working through CLRS at the time.</p>
