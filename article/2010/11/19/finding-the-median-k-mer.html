          <p>For this algorithms assignment, we had to incrementally optimize an algorithm
for finding the median k-mer of a DNA sequence.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Pseudo-code was given for a naive implementation so I first implemented that.
Then, I added the branch-and-bound mechanism which significantly sped things
up. Then, I implemented the trie to store k-mers which allowed me to optimize
the algorithm to search promising k-mers first which sped things up slightly
more.</p>

<p>I was worried before submitting because my computer at home was slow and didnâ€™t
pass tests as quickly as others but when I did it in the lab, it was 3x faster
(in a class on algorithms where we talk about big-O, it annoyed me that they
gave an absolute time for what we should shoot for). My score ended up being
19/20 so I must of done it mostly right.</p>
