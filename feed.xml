    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Talk about a deceptively simple assignment. Two parts: implement
‘immediate files’ and ‘encryption’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were times when a single line of code took hours to research. The lecture
content was basically: there exists a VFS and data is stored in blocks. I
walked the &lt;a href="http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v2.6.36/fs/"&gt;Linux source tree&lt;/a&gt; down from
the open and write system calls through the VFS layer to the block device
driver to understand this stuff and it was a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We had to implement a linux device driver interface to an encryption
‘coprocessor’. The driver performs a XOR-based stream cipher since we didn’t
have special encryption hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By far, the most interesting and most fun assignment I’ve ever had. The
lectures consisted of just about zero information about how to go about this so
there was a fair bit of research to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to make full use of the Linux kernel &lt;a href="http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v2.6.36/include/linux/list.h"&gt;linked list&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v2.6.36/include/linux/circ_buf.h"&gt;circular buffer&lt;/a&gt;
macros.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;To learn about thread scheduling we had to modify the &lt;a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/pth"&gt;Pth&lt;/a&gt;
scheduler to implement fairness across all threads in a single process using a
lottery mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy to ensure fairness is “fair share with priorities” as described in
the design specification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to do this again, I would not use malloc and friends — they are way
to slow for hundreds of tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a warm-up exercise for this class on Operating System Architecture, we had
to implement ‘ls’, ‘cp’, and ‘rm -rf’ as built-in commands to a custom shell
using direct system calls instead of the C-library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘ls’ command needed to print its result in a specific way and the ‘cp’
command wasn’t supposed to deal with multiple files or directories.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The final project for a course on software projects. I worked in a team of six.
We needed to go through the full SDLC from project charter to deployment with
user manual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My team came from various backgrounds and three of us were the core programmers
(I was one of them). I was the one who chose to use the &lt;a href="http://appfuse.org/display/APF/Home"&gt;AppFuse framework&lt;/a&gt;
so I had to learn to use it and help the others get acquainted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wrote most of the documentation together but I worked alone on the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/piannaf/tigers/blob/master/docs/2010-10-11_Final%20Project%20Folder/System%20Manual.docx"&gt;System&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/piannaf/tigers/blob/master/docs/2010-10-11_Final%20Project%20Folder/User%20Manual.docx"&gt;User&lt;/a&gt; manuals so I’ve linked to them directly here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For this algorithms assignment, we had to incrementally optimize an algorithm
for finding the median k-mer of a DNA sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pseudo-code was given for a naive implementation so I first implemented that.
Then, I added the branch-and-bound mechanism which significantly sped things
up. Then, I implemented the trie to store k-mers which allowed me to optimize
the algorithm to search promising k-mers first which sped things up slightly
more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was worried before submitting because my computer at home was slow and didn’t
pass tests as quickly as others but when I did it in the lab, it was 3x faster
(in a class on algorithms where we talk about big-O, it annoyed me that they
gave an absolute time for what we should shoot for). My score ended up being
19/20 so I must of done it mostly right.&lt;/p&gt;
